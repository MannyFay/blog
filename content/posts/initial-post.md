## This is the initial blog post for the MVP.
I'm glad you are here! This is the beginning of my blogging journey.

With this blog, it is proven that the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of my blog, created with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and the [Coder-Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-coder/), is working.
